### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Gazi**](https://gazijarin.com), a software engineer and artist in New York City.

I currently work as a software engineer at [**@Google**](https://github.com/google), where I help build Proxybidder ML models that make Google Search money. Previously, I was at [**@Amazon**](https://github.com/aws) and [**@Pinterest**](https://github.com/pinterest).

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and have worked on industry-leading services as well as apps that have 100M+ installs. I have contributed to major feature launches and automating systems in customer-facing consoles with high traffic.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I make [art](https://polyliths.tumblr.com/), play video games and make tech-related content (over 1M+ combined followers and counting).
