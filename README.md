### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Gazi**](https://gazijarin.com), a software engineer from Toronto, Canada.

I'm primarily interested in **full-stack development** and currently work as a
software engineer at [**@Pinterest**](https://github.com/pinterest). ðŸ“Œ Previously, I was at [**@Amazon**](https://github.com/aws).

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and have worked on industry-leading services as well as apps that have 100M+ installs. I have contributed to major feature launches and automating systems in customer-facing consoles with high traffic.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I also play a lot of video games and make tech-related TikToks (530,000 followers and counting).
